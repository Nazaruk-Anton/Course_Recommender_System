# Course_Recommender_System
The main goal of this project is to improve learners' learning experience via helping them quickly ﬁnd new interested   courses and better paving their learning paths. Meanwhile, with more learners interacting with more courses via your  recommender systems, your company's revenue may also be increased.
This project is currently at the Proof of Concept (PoC) phase so the main focus at this moment is to explore and compare  various machine learning models and ﬁnd one with the best performance in off-line evaluations.
