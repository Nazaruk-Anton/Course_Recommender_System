# Course_Recommender_System
The objective of this project is to create a recommender system that will assist students in discovering new courses that are in line with their interests and academic objectives.The improved user experience will lead to more enrollments, more new users, and more revenue for the business.

Hypothesis: In order to find new courses that the user would be interested in, we can use information about the user's prior enrollments as well as information about the course's characteristics.
